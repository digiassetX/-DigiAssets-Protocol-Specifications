The DigiByte core developers provide a tesnet and mainnet API for developers to use when first getting started with DigiAssets. While we provide this to help people get started, we recommend companies, and services run their own infrastructure to keep DigiAssets as decentralized as possible. 

To set up and run your own API you need to run, digibyted, digiassetsd, DigiAssets Block Explorer and DigiAssets metadata handler.

Here are the main URLs for our public DigiAssets.net Api:

#Mainnet
api.digiassets.net/v3
explorerapi.digiassets.net

#Testnet
testnetapi.digiassets.net/v3
testnetexplorerapi.digiassets.net
