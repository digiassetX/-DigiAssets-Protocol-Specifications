# The DigiAssets Protocol 
DigiAssets is a secure, scalable secondary layer on top of the global DigiByte blockchain that allows for the decentralized issuance of assets, tokens, smart contracts, digital identity and much more. DigiAssets can be used to securely and cryptographically represent anything we find in the real world. From real-world assets such as real estate, airplanes, boats and cars to scarce digital pieces of art and music. Signed documents such as wills, deeds, and purchase orders to medical bills and advertisement data and info can be protected as DigiAssets.

DigiAssets as an ecosystem and platform already has interested parties planning and or working to build platforms in real estate, finance, remittance, identity, point of sale, racing, trade, healthcare, supply chain, government and more.

DigiAssets leverages unique aspects of a truly decentralized blockchain only found within a blockchain like DigiByte that have never been publicly discussed in most blockchain circles. This allows DigiAssets to be more secure, scalable and decentralized than any other platform yet seen in the market.
